## 🔍 Framework Overview
<img src="./Figure0.png" width=92%>

**MARQA**: This study develops MARQA (Maritime Autonomous Reasoning for Question Answering), an algorithm utilizing large language models (LLMs) to enable navigational question-and-answer interactions between vessels.

## 🌟 Highlights
- **`2025-03-31`** Our paper has been submitted to the T-ITS journal and is currently under review.
  
## 📩 Getting Started

## 🎯 MARQA-Benchmark
We propose `MARQA-Benchmark', the first benchmark for question-and-answer algorithms used in ship navigation. It includes over 8,000 human-validated question-and-answer pairs based on COLREG encounter situations. We made diverse combinations for the five types of COLREG encounter situations. Dataset will be generated for encounters involving a single ship as well as situations where two ships meet.
